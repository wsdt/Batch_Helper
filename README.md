This batch application helps you to 
- WormShot control panel (see [Batch_WormShot-repository](https://github.com/wsdt/Batch_WormShot)) to control a Windows device remotely
- manage homework
- manage notes
- rembering important dates (calendar functionality)
- has some easter-eggs (e.g. on special days)
- a special computer lock (more gamification, but can confuse other people so it might be useful ^^)
- a native chatbot with a modular profile interface and random moods
- a countdown for school timetables (one works and is hardcoded, the other one is dynamic for any timetable but does not work)
- deleting/restart print queue
- hacking "trick/game" -> simulates a noob hacking attack on an arbitrary website
- and much more etc. 

## Contribution and info
As I wrote this application when I was appr. 12-14 years old (and also was my first "scripting/programming language"), some things might not work anymore, might be hardcoded (like paths) or might be written inefficient. The application is still in use for small things (e.g. when I want to restart my printing queue ^^), but is NOT maintained by me. 

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)
Nevertheless, pull-requests and issues are welcome. 

## There might be some files, which are not BY ME (e.g. music, a copy of a facebook-profile page, etc.)
I just let them there to not entirely break the application. But if anyone wants me to remove those files I will do it, just write me an e-mail (kevin.riedl.privat@gmail.com) or post an issue. Also a pull-request is fine. Thank you in advance and sorry for the inconvenience.
