This batch application helps you to 
- manage homework
- manage notes
- rembering important dates (calendar functionality)
- has some easter-eggs (e.g. on special days)
- a special computer lock (more gamification, but can confuse other people so it might be useful ^^)
- a native chatbot with a modular profile interface and random moods
- a countdown for school timetables (one works and is hardcoded, the other one is dynamic for any timetable but does not work)
- deleting/restart print queue
- hacking "trick/game" -> simulates a noob hacking attack on an arbitrary website
- and much more etc. 

## Contribution and info
As I wrote this application when I was appr. 12-14 years old (and also was my first "scripting/programming language"), some things might not work anymore or might be written inefficient. The application is still in use for small things (e.g. when I want to restart my printing queue ^^), but is NOT maintained by me.
